Nov 2: 
(goals)
* Generate Q-PSK samples
* Find the characteristics of a linear classifier that can predict a user's precense
* Demonstrate how this task becomes harder  as SNR decreases: graph that  shows predictor accuracy over decreasing snr

(accomplished)
* Generated some Q-PSK samples 
* Decided to use svm classifer (has fit/predict functions in library) that will train on training set and specified snr
* Wrote scaffold for classifier

(to immediately do)
* Map accuracy vs a degrading snr
